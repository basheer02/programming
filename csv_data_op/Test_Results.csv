مع إشراقة شمش الرياض الساطعة ، أقف على حافة عصر جديد. فأنا شاب من منطقة القصيم الجميلة، أجد نفسي الآن في قلب الرياض النابض في ظل ازدهار المملكة العربية السعودية الرقمية الصاعدة في كل يوم، أتواصل مع عقول بريطانية وأسترالية وأمريكية بارعة، أتبادل معهم الأفكار، وأنمو تحت الغطاء الواسع للابتكار الرقمي.

وكوني وسط هذه العقول العظيمة، أشعر بموجة من الترقب ممزوجة بإحساس لا يمكن وصفه . فالجوّ مليء بالإمكانيات، كالرياح التي تحمل عطر نخيل التمور في واحتنا الصحراوية الجميلة.

ومع ذلك، أنا لست مجرد مراقب في هذا العالم؛ بل أنا مشارك نشط. أحمل تراثي قريبًا من قلبي، وأتطلع إلى تقديم وجهة نظري لهذا التقاطع العالمي. أحمل معي ليس فقط حكمة أسلافي ولكن أيضاً روح التجديد الخاصة بجيلي.

إنّ دهشتي من زملائي الأجانب ليست فقط عن معرفتهم أو خبراتهم، بل عن إمكانية التبادل الثقافي. أنا معلمهم بقدر ما أنا طالبهم. أملك مفاتيح الثقافة السعودية الحقيقية، بعيدة عن العدسة المكسرة للإعلام العالمي. أتطلع إلى إظهار الضيافة المشهورة لدينا، وتاريخنا الغني، وتقاليدنا الحية.

لكن رحلتي ليست فقط عن الصداقة و الثقافة المتبادلة. بل الإبداع والابتكار وتقديم أرقى الخبرات في هذا العالم الواسع الملئ بالابتكارات الرقمية والتقنية .",True,"[11, 50]",15.0,2019.0,"AI, Blockchain, Prototyping, Design Thinking, Agile, Immersive Experience, Digital Transformation, Digital Strategy, Computer Vision, Innovation Strategy, Cloud",,,"Organization Name:                    Organization

180,198,UPM,,Mohammed Moalla,Executive Director of Career & Professional Development Center at University of Prince Mugrin,"Hey there! 👋 I'm Mohammed Moalla, a passionate professional with a knack for driving revenue and profitability. With a strong background in quality and development, strategic planning, market analysis, and projects initiation, I am well-equipped to excel in the field of Business Development within international quality standards. 🚀

In my current role as the Vice Dean of Student Affairs, Admission and Registration for Quality and Development at the University of Prince Mugrin, I have been instrumental in maintaining local and international quality standards while ensuring effective procedures that satisfy our stakeholders. By improving and developing our services within a continuous development framework, I am actively contributing to the realization of KSA's 2030 objectives for a brighter future. My expertise lies in customer experience, education leadership, problem-solving, quality assurance, project implementation, engineering, and management communication.

Prior to this, as a Mechatronics Engineering Lecturer at UPM, I played a pivotal role in teaching and developing engineering core courses while also serving as the designated Quality Assurance Officer. My achievements include establishing the EE club from scratch and automating the student advising system to streamline procedures. Additionally, I successfully automated the coordination of courses per faculty for the entire university and reduced procurement costs by 60% through reverse engineering lab teaching equipment without compromising the teaching experience.

During my tenure as a Construction Project Manager, I led multiple construction teams while integrating solar panels into designs to reduce electricity consumption. Implementing smart home design on lighting and water faucets further contributed to sustainable practices.

I hold an MSc (Eng) Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering degree from the University of Leeds along with a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Automation Engineering from The University of Manchester. 

Outside of work, I took part in representing Saudi Arabia in IVLP: Entrepreneurship and Technology, sponsored by the US Department, I have obtained certifications such as Training of Trainers from the TVTC, and SCE member.

I am excited to leverage my diverse skill set and experience to contribute to the growth and success of a Business Development role. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to achieve remarkable results! 🤝",True,,,,,,,"Organization Name:                    Organization

253,271,SAMI Advanced Electronics,,Narendra Pingale,Senior Manager Corporate Strategy at Advanced Electronics Company,"As a Strategy and Finance professional, I have over 14 years of proven expertise in Corporate Strategy, Mergers & Acquisitions, Corporate Finance, Financial Planning & Analysis and Stakeholder Management. I have formed strategy plans and have led tactical project implementation for businesses across South East Asia, the Middle East, Africa and North America within Aviation, FMCG, Information Technology and Financial Services. I thoroughly enjoy leading and working with cross-cultural teams.

In my current role, I work with the CEO at 'SAMI Advanced Electronics' - a pioneer in the field of Defense & Aerospace industry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I work on implementing long term strategy projects that lead to revenue maximization, cost optimization and market expansion in the MENA region.

In my previous roles, I have worked extensively with internal & external stakeholders to implement multi-billion-dollar projects that led to long term performance improvement. At Flynas (award winning airline in KSA), I led multiple initiatives that resulted in business expansion as well as improvement in bottom-line by ~ $120 Mn annually. At World Bank, I worked on infrastructure, energy, and health projects in Africa, Middle East, and conflict countries in Asia. As a team leader at Hewlett Packard Enterprises, I led my team to become one of the best across all HPE offices in Chennai and brought in a 5 million CAD (approximately 3.82 million USD) contract. In 2016, I won a “Leading the Way” award for leading a support team of 45 during the Chennai floods.

A firm believer in education as a key for development, I was a member of the CSR teams at both World Bank and HPE to work with NGOs that teach and mentor under privileged kids. Have been a volunteer at UNICEF and at Health First India Organization since 2010.

Strategy Planning, Financial Modeling, Investor Pitches and Data Analysis are my specialities.

I enjoy meeting new people and understanding their perspectives. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about Strategy Planning, FinTech, Financial Trends, Sports or Movies.",True,,,,,,,"Organization Name:                    Organization
